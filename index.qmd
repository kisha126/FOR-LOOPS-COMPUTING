## Introduction

In this document, I will show you how to wrap and interpret the programming of the programming languages into R and how they can be used in computing then evaluate them into R. And also, I will share you my experiences of using these languages.

Note that not all the programming languages are listed and used in this documents. The programming languages listed and used in this document are all the programming languages I know where you can write a code within them, as well as to integrate, and call them into R.

This document is written in Quarto Website.

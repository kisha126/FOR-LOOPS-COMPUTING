## Introduction

In this document, I will show you the programming languages that can be used in computing with the use of `for` loops and how to wrap them into R. And also, I will share you my experiences of using these languages.

Note that not all the programming languages are listed and used in this documents. The programming languages listed and used in this document  are all the programming languages I know where you can write a code within it, integrate, and call them into R.

This document is written in Quarto Website.
